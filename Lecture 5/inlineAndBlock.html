<!-- Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.

The two most common display values are block and inline.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

The <p> element is a block-level element.

The <div> element is a block-level element.
Example
<p>Hello World</p>
<div>Hello World</div>
Here are the block-level elements in HTML: -->

<!-- <address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video> -->
<!-- Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph. -->

                            <!-- Example -->
<span>Hello World</span>




                <!-- Here are the inline elements in HTML: -->

<!-- <a><
  abbr> <acronym> <b>  <bdo>  <big>  <br>      <button>     <cite><code>     <dfn><em>     <i>     <img>     <input>     <kbd>     <label>     <map>     <object>     <output>     <q>     <samp>     <script>     <select>     <small>     <span>     <strong>     <sub>     <sup>     <textarea>     <time>     <tt>     <var>
Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.

The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

Example -->
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<!-- The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:

Example -->
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
