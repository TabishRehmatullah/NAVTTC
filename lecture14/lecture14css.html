<!-- CSS height and width Values
The height and width properties may have the following values:

auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
length - Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
% - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div {
  height: 200px;
  width: 50%;
  background-color: powderblue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Set the height and width of an element</h2>

<div>This div element has a height of 200px and a width of 50%.</div>

</body>
</html>



<!-- 
Setting max-width
The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows. -->
